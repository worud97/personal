            <span>Final project for Design Thinking course, we designed the iNTEREST app to reduce structural inequality among majors, minors, and non-majors caused by information gaps at the University of Washington. Our app is to make information currently only exclusive to Informatics students also available to students who might not be of the major, but are interested in the information that is provided by the iSchool, without increasing the workload for the iSchool faculty. </span>

            <span>We interviewed three students at the University of Washington with different major statuses to learn about the different, but all possible users of our app.  </span>
            <h5>Interviewee A - Junior, 21, Psychology Major (Intended Informatics)</h5>
            <span>
                Interviewee A is an intended Informatics student. Being a junior, A was under pressure to get into a major, thus applied and got accepted into the Psychology major. However, A wishes to apply for and get accepted into Informatics again during the next application cycle. Because of her passion for Informatics, she actively seeks out to gain information about the events and opportunities offered by the program. However, she experiences a limitation to what she can find about the opportunities by herself. Because she does not receive these information but has to seek them by her own abilities, she finds that she is behind those who are in the major.     
            </span>
            <h5>Interviewee B - Junior, 21, Art Major & Informatics Minor</h5>
            <span>
                Interviewee B applied for Informatics in her sophomore year, but unfortunately got rejected. She is already an Art major, so she decided to minor in Informatics. However, she can’t get into all the core classes, and she doesn’t receive emails about weekly events or other resources offered by the iSchool. 
            </span>
            <h5>Interviewee C - Sophomore, 19, Psychology Major (Intended Informatics)</h5>
            <span>
                Interviewee C is not sure what Informatics really is, yet she still wants to apply because many of her friends are in the technology field and she thinks she can gain more useful knowledge from the major. She hopes to get more information about what people do in Informatics.

            <h4 class="orange-text">Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p>Upon research, we found that there are a few existing solutions for this problem.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col s4">
                    <h6>iSchool Website</h6>
                    <p><img class="responsive-img" src="img/interest/iSchool.png"></p>
                    <span>
                        Contains a lot of information about academics, admissions, careers, and events offered by the iSchool. However, the events page does not contain all the information that Informatics students receive through email newsletters. 
                    </span>
                </div>
                <div class="col s4">
                    <h6>IUGA (Informatics Undergraduate Associations) Facebook Page</h6>
                    <p><img class="responsive-img" src="img/interest/IUGA.png"></p>
                    <span>
                        IUGA is available to any and all students who are interested in Informatics and wish to become more involved and informed about the major. Posts on the IUGA page contain social event information as well as education information from the iSchool advisors. Although informative, the page is disorganized and are more operated by students rather than by advisors. Also, social related contents typically override educational posts, resulting in students not being able to perceive certain important news.                    </span>
                </div>
                <div class="col s4">

                    <p><img class="responsive-img" src="img/interest/iCareers.png"></p>
                    <span>
                        These websites are current solutions for career, internship, and research opportunities. However, the iCareers website is exclusive to Informatics students, and many features of the page are not actually utilized. In addition, HuskyJobs page is for all majors and all types of jobs. So looking for job and research opportunities related to Informatics might be difficult to find for students who might not know much about Informatics.                    </span>

            <h6>Interviewee A: </h6>
            <span>
                Interviewee A found that our application well addressed and solved the problem. However, as someone who actively seeks out for information herself, she admitted to how she might not actually download the application because there are pre-existing solutions such as the Facebook IUGA page or the iSchool website that she already uses to receive these types of information. From that, she said that our design might be good for freshmen or sophomores who might be interested in Informatics but might not be as involved or aware of these social communities and ways to receive information. She also stated that our home page was overloaded with information and that the home page should only include the most important information. Besides that, Interviewee A liked how these information were nicely organized and categorized into this one app. 
            </span>
            <h6>Interviewee B: </h6>
            <span>
                Interviewee B is another potential user of our app. She stated that she thought this was a good way to reach out to students who are interested in Informatics and people who are not in the Informatics major email list. However, she doubted about some of the functions that the app has, for instance, the discussion part. She thought there are many functions that already exist, and there might be no people to respond to her post on this application. In addition, she thinks having a more organized and easy way to find jobs, discussion, and announcements is very unique, but she was wondering what will happen to the IUGA page, and confused if she should still go check on the IUGA page for some information that is important. Overall, she thought this app was great solution to fix the gap between Informatics students and non-informatics students, but she is not sure if many people will actually find the need to use it.
